## 2026-08-08 - Atomic Nonce Verification for Replay Prevention
**Vulnerability:** TOCTOU race condition in `pkg/signing/verify.go` allowed concurrent duplicate requests with identical nonces to bypass replay protection because `isReplayedNonce` checked nonces before `recordNonce` was called at the end of message verification.
**Learning:** Checking nonces separately from recording them leaves a race condition window under concurrent load, and checking nonces before signature verification allows unauthenticated requests to pollute or query nonce tracking.
**Prevention:** Perform cryptographic signature verification first, followed by an atomic check-and-record operation for nonces under mutex lock.
